The customer is then prompted through inquirer to choose an item from the table. 
<!-- Insert pic of first prompt -->

Once the customer has entered the item they would like to purchase, they are once again prompted through inquirer and asked the quantity of the item they would like to purchase.
<!-- Insert pic of second prompt -->

After the customer has input the item and quantity, the stock quantity is updated.
<!-- Insert pic of stock that has been updated -->
